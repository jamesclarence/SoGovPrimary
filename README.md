============

A replication of 538's presidential primary and general election analysis using Southern gubernatorial results.

It's an attempt at replicating Harry Enten's FiveThirtyEight
primary margin of victory and general election margin of victory at the state level.
I use Southern state gubernatorial primary and general election results from Tennessee, Georgia, Alabama, and Florida going back to 1990.
